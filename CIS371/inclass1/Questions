How can you tell from the response headers that the request for NoSuchFile.html failed?

	The header contains : 404 Not Found


What (if anything) was written to the file? Where did this data come from?

	<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
	<html><head>
	<title>404 Not Found</title>
	</head><body>
	<h1>Not Found</h1>
	<p>The requested URL /~kurmasz/NoSuchFile.html was not found on this server.</p>
	</body></html>

	This is what is returned in the body when a file does not exist. This tells the browser that there is no such file.


Did it work? Why not?

	No, we are using the wrong type of reader/writer.
